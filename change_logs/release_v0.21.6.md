# Release v0.21.6

## Notes

Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues and enhancements for Popeye! I'll try to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest rev and see if we're happier with some of the fixes! If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close. Your support, kindness and awesome suggestions to make Popeye better is as ever very much noticed and appreciated!

This project offers a GitHub Sponsor button (over here ðŸ‘†). As you well know this is not pimped out by big corps with deep pockets. If you feel `Popeye` is saving you cycles diagnosing potential cluster issues please consider sponsoring this project!! It does go a long way in keeping our servers lights on and beers in our fridge.

Also if you dig this tool, please make some noise on social! [@kitesurfer](https://twitter.com/kitesurfer)
